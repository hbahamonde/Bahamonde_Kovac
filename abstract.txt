Power remains a crucial concept in international relations. In recent decades a prevailing notion became present in the literature explaining that economic power is a prerequisite for all other forms of power (military, political and cultural). Yet, such an assumption has never been properly tested. To test this assumption, the paper introduces a new time-series method to political science---Global Vector Auto-regression (GVAR). While the method is widely used in economics, it has not been employed in political science. The method should be appealing to scholars in political science since it enables big-N and big-T hypotheses tests. We also present Granger-causality tests within the context of GVAR and test if economic power is a prerequisite for military power. Our results suggest that the role of the economy has changed through history. Namely, in 19th century it was the military power that drove (Granger-caused) the economy; yet, since  1955 the roles are reversed.
